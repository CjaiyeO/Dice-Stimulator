# Dice Stimulator
This is a simple Python program that simulates rolling dice. It allows the user to specify the number of dice to roll and then displays the result of each roll in a graphical representation.

# Getting Started
- To use this Dice Stimulator, you'll need to have python installed in your system, the random module is part of the Python Standard Library, so it comes bundled with Python itself.
- import random

# Prerequisite
- Python 3.x

# Program Logic
- First, we need to specify the number of dice we want to select.
- The program uses the `random.randint()` function provided by the 'random' module to simulate rolling a die with 6 faces. It then generates a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive, representing the face of the die. Depending on the result, it prints out a graphical       representation of the die face using ASCII art.
